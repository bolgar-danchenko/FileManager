# FileManager

Homework for the Netology lesson "FileManager, UserDefaults, Keychain":

The app is a simple file manager that allows users to add pictures and folders.
Added files and folders are stored in the FileManager.
Pictures can be added from the Image Picker.

Upon the first launch, the user needs to create a password that will be saved in the Keychain. The password can be changed in Settings. Furthermore, it is possible to sign in with Face ID / Touch ID.

Additional settings allow users to order files and folders by name and to show/hide file size. These settings are stored in UserDefaults.
